ECC-OCaml
=========

Elliptic Curves Cryptography for OCaml.
This library provides the basic arithmetic operations in elliptic curves over finite prime fields (over finite bit fields coming soon :) 
as well as functions for Elliptic Curve digital signature algorithm and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.
